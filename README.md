Algorithmic Trading Backtest Engine

A modular backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies on historical market data. Designed for quantitative developers and algorithmic traders, this engine allows seamless integration of custom strategies, risk management, and portfolio tracking, with results exportable for further analysis.

⸻

Features
	•	Event-driven architecture: Processes MarketEvent, OrderEvent, and FillEvent objects to simulate realistic market behavior.
	•	Strategy interface: Define custom trading strategies by inheriting from the Strategy base class.
	•	Portfolio management: Tracks cash, positions, and equity dynamically.
	•	Risk management hooks: Optional RiskManager to control order execution.
	•	Metrics tracking: Time-series portfolio equity is recorded and exportable to CSV.
	•	Extensible and modular: Easily add new asset types, events, or strategies.

Architecture

Event System

The engine operates on three core event types:
	1.	MarketEvent: Represents a market data update, such as price changes.
	2.	OrderEvent: Generated by strategies to indicate an intention to buy/sell.
	3.	FillEvent: Represents executed trades and updates the portfolio accordingly.

Events are processed sequentially, with strategies reacting to MarketEvents to produce OrderEvents, which are then converted into FillEvents.

Strategy Interface

All strategies must inherit from the abstract Strategy class and implement:

virtual void on_market_event(const MarketEvent& e, Portfolio& portfolio, std::vector<std::shared_ptr<OrderEvent>>& orders) = 0;

	•	on_market_event: Triggered whenever new market data arrives.
	•	Portfolio: Provides access to current cash, positions, and trading functions.
	•	orders: Output vector where new OrderEvents are appended.

Example: BuyAndHoldStrategy buys fixed quantities of selected assets at the first timestep and holds them.

Portfolio
	•	Tracks cash, positions, and overall equity.
	•	Updates positions on FillEvents and recalculates equity per timestep.
	•	Provides utility methods:
	•	buy(symbol, quantity, price)
	•	sell(symbol, quantity, price)
	•	apply_fill(FillEvent& e)
	•	mark_to_market(MarketEvent& e)

Metrics
	•	Tracks equity evolution over time.
	•	Exportable to CSV using:

metrics.export_to_csv("../results/results.csv");

Sample CSV format:

TimeStep,Equity
0,66719.5
1,44629.5

Usage

Setup
	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Ensure you have CMake and a C++17 compiler installed.
	3.	Build the project:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

Running a Backtest

./BacktestEngine

	•	Strategy, portfolio, and events are configured in main.cpp.
	•	Results are printed to the console and exported to results.csv.

Extending the Engine
	•	Custom Strategies: Inherit from Strategy and implement on_market_event.
	•	Risk Management: Implement a RiskManager to control orders before execution.
	•	Asset Types: Extend Asset or add new market data sources.

⸻

Notes
	•	The engine assumes an idealized, frictionless market for simplicity.
	•	Equity is updated dynamically per timestep using the latest market prices.
	•	Designed for educational, prototyping, and quantitative research purposes.
